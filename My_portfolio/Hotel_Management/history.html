            "Vasantrao naik mahavidyalaya was started by vasantrao naik shikshan prasarak mandal in 1972. It was the product of the vision of principal rajaram rathod sir to start an institution for the advancement of socially and economically underprivileged, principal rathod himself came from one such community and was aware of the hardships that these students faced."

           Influenced by the great visionaries such as jyotiba phule and dr. B. R. Ambedkar, he wanted to establish an institution for the underprivileged and women in central maharashtra. Therefore he selected aurangabad and started an arts and commerce college in the name of late shri vasantraoji naik (ex. Chief minister, mah.) who has been a source of inspiration for all of us.

    The institution began its career in the face of severe drought, when the conditions were far from favorable. But the need for such an institution justified its beginning. We are indebted to late shri. Uttamrao rathod (ex. Member of parliment) and late mr.sudhakarrao naik (ex. Chief minister, maharashtra) for their guidance and help in treading the path steadily and secularly. Vasantrao naik shikshan prasarak could not take up this enormous task without the help of army of teachers who had merit as well as social commitment. Most of the students came from weaker sections of the community, specially from scheduled castes and denotified tribes like banjaras, pardhis, tadwis, rajput bhamta and others and were enrolled in “earn and learn” scheme, as

        They had hardly any money to pay for the facilities. Faculty would stay all day in the college and would visit hostel during the evenings, not only to supervise their studies, but also to teach them a few lessons in health and hygiene. Many of the students could boast of a mother tongue but it was devoid of any script. So special efforts were made to improve their language skills. Lectures of eminent personalities were arranged throughout the year to bring these students in the mainstream of national life. They were taught civic sense and introduced to the liberal values enshrined in the constitution like liberty, equality and secularism.

        College was located in an area, which was away from the city and was routinely called a “tanda” (tribal settlement) by the city dwellers. But as the vision was correct, results came and it soon became a prosperous seat of learning. After this initial stage of establishment and consolidation, we are now in the midst of the next logical stage of diversification and quality improvement. As the residential and industrial area in the vicinity of the college increased, it was imperative to add the science faculty to cater the needs of the times. Science faculty was added to the college in 1990, management science in 1999 and now we also have computer science to satisfy he dreams of many. Composition of the college has changed and girl students are in large numbers. So, without loosing our social perspective, we are now engaged in quality control and quality improvement programs. We are happy to note that vasantrao naik mahavidyalaya has completed a successful sojourn of three decades, it has sculpted and shaped the future of thousands of students from the low socio-economic strata over the years and has thereby contributed significantly to the educational environs of maharashtra.
